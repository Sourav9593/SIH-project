        <strong>MAURYAN ART</strong>
        <p><br><br>: The Mauryan Empire, which extended across much of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan.
            The Mauryan Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya, is renowned for its significant contributions to Indian art and architecture. The art from this period reflects the power and grandeur of the empire, as well as the influence of Buddhism, which gained prominence under Emperor Ashoka.
            
        <br>   <br><h3>1. Pillars of Ashoka</h3> 
        <br>   <br> Material: Polished sandstone.
        <br>   <br>	Description: The Ashokan pillars are one of the most iconic symbols of Mauryan art. These monolithic pillars, erected by Emperor Ashoka, are inscribed with edicts promoting Buddhist values such as non-violence, tolerance, and moral conduct. The pillars are characterized by their smooth, highly polished surfaces and often topped with animal capitals, the most famous being the Lion Capital of Sarnath.
        <br>   <br>	Lion Capital of Sarnath: This capital, now the national emblem of India, features four back-to-back lions standing on a circular abacus decorated with four animals (an elephant, a horse, a bull, and a lion), symbolizing the spread of Buddhism in all directions.
        <br>   <br>	Locations: The pillars are found across the Indian subcontinent, with significant examples in Sarnath, Lauriya-Nandangarh, and Delhi (Feroz Shah Kotla).
        
<br><br><h3> 2. Stupas</h3> 
<br><br><h2>	Material</h2> Brick, stone, and earth.
<br><br><h2>	Description</h2> The Mauryan period saw the construction of stupas, which are dome-shaped structures used to house Buddhist relics and serve as places of meditation. The most famous of these is the Great Stupa at Sanchi. Built by Ashoka, this stupa is one of the oldest stone structures in India and features a large hemispherical dome, a central chamber containing relics, and an elaborately carved stone railing and gateways (toranas).
<br><br><h2>	Architectural Significance</h2> The Sanchi Stupa is notable for its harmonious proportions and the symbolic representation of the Buddha’s life and teachings on its gateways.
<br><br><h2>	Other Examples</h2> Stupas were also built at sites like Bharhut and Amaravati, although many were later modified or rebuilt in subsequent periods.

<br><br><h3> 3. Rock-Cut Architecture</h3> 
<br><br>	<h2>Material</h2> Rock and stone.
<br><br>	<h2>Description</h2> The Mauryan period marked the beginning of rock-cut architecture in India, particularly in the form of caves used by Buddhist monks as monastic retreats. These caves, known as Chaitya-grihas (prayer halls) and Viharas (monasteries), were carved out of living rock and featured simple, austere interiors, in contrast to the more elaborate rock-cut architecture of later periods.
<br><br>	<h2>Barabar Caves</h2> Located in Bihar, these are some of the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India. The caves, commissioned by Ashoka and his grandson Dasaratha, were dedicated to the Ajivika sect and are noted for their highly polished interiors and precise, geometric forms.
<br><br><h2>	Architectural Elements</h2> The caves typically feature a barrel-vaulted ceiling, with entrances and interiors meticulously carved. The simplicity and functionality of these spaces reflect the ascetic lifestyle of the monks.

<br><br><h2>	Materials</h2> Gold, silver, copper, semi-precious stones (like carnelian, lapis lazuli, and agate), and shells.
<br><br><h2>	Description</h2> Jewelry was an essential part of the Indus Valley culture, worn by both men and women. The designs were sophisticated, with beads, necklaces, bangles, earrings, and amulets being common. The beadwork was particularly advanced, with artisans using drilling techniques to create detailed designs
<br><br><h3> 4. Sculpture</h3> 
<br><br><h2>	Material</h2> Stone and terracotta.
<br><br><h2>	Description</h2> Mauryan sculpture is characterized by its naturalism and attention to detail. The sculptures from this period often depict animals, deities, and royal figures.
<br><br><h2>	Yaksha and Yakshi Statues</h2> These are life-sized figures of male and female nature spirits that were worshipped as fertility deities. The most famous examples include the Yakshi from Didarganj, which is notable for its polished finish and voluptuous form, and the Yaksha from Parkham, which displays a robust and powerful physique.
<br><br><h2>	Animal Sculptures</h2> The animal capitals of the Ashokan pillars, particularly the lions, are remarkable for their realism and dynamic form, symbolizing the power and authority of the Mauryan Empire.
