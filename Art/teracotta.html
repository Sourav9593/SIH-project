        <br><br>o	Regional Variations: The style of terracotta jewelry varied by region, with different areas developing unique patterns, colors, and motifs. For example, West Bengal is still known today for its traditional terracotta jewelry, which is often inspired by nature and religious symbols. 

        <br><br>Significance: Terracotta art in India is not just a testament to the artistic skills of ancient communities but also provides valuable insights into their daily lives, religious beliefs, and social structures. The durability of terracotta artifacts has allowed them to survive over millennia, offering a window into the past. From simple utilitarian objects to highly decorative and symbolic art forms, terracotta has played a vital role in the cultural heritage of India. Even today, terracotta continues to be a vibrant part of Indian art and craft traditions, especially in regions like West Bengal, where the legacy of terracotta art is still alive and thriving.
        <br><br>Overview: Terracotta art in India has a long and storied history, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization and continuing through various periods in Indian history. Terracotta, a type of earthenware, is made from natural clay that is shaped and then fired at a low temperature to harden. This medium was widely used due to the availability of clay and the relative ease of working with it. Terracotta artifacts range from simple pottery to intricate sculptures and figurines, reflecting the daily life, religious practices, and cultural values of ancient Indian societies.

The figurines were used for various purposes, including religious rituals, toys for children, and household decorations.
        <br><br>	<h2>Indus Valley Figurines</h2> These include representations of women, possibly fertility goddesses, with detailed hairstyles, jewelry, and clothing. Animal figurines, such as bulls, dogs, and birds, were also common.

        <br><br>	<h2>Later Periods</h2> In later periods, pottery evolved to include more decorative elements, such as intricate carvings, stamped designs, and painted motifs. The shapes of the pots also became more varied, including jars, bowls, cups, and ritual vessels.

The craftsmanship displayed in these panels is remarkable, with intricate details and dynamic compositions.
